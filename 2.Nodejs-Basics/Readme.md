# Node.js basics

-   fs (file system)
-   cli (command line interface)
-   hash
-   modules
-   streams (read & write)
-   worker_threads
-   cp (Child Processes)
-   zip (decompress & compress file)
-   note: to keep the console cleaner, the "throw new Error" object itself is created but not printed to the console. Only error.message is printed to the console;
